# find snippet files that are simply called 'snippets.json'

# should look for names that are not a language id (more complex) 
# https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/identifiers lists official ones but flutter and dart are not there
# so obviously its a subset!

# project level e.g. play project
find "/Users/Andy/Devel/vscode-extensions/play/.vscode/"*.code-snippets -name snippets.json 

# user level
find "/Users/andy/Library/Application Support/Code/User/snippets"/* -name snippets.json

# extensions e.g. .../dart-code.dart-code-3.13.1/snippets/dart.json
find /Users/andy/.vscode/extensions/*/snippets -name snippets.json

# built in
find "/Applications/Visual Studio Code.app/Contents/Resources/app/extensions/"*/snippets -name snippets.json
